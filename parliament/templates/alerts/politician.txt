Hi! This alert feature is brand new. Even newer than the rest of the site.
So it's still plain text. I'll be switching to a prettier e-mail format, um,
as soon as I build that feature. A few days, probably. Thanks for being
one of the first people to try these alerts!

Here's what {{ alert.politician.name }} had to say in the House of Commons.

{% for statement in statements %}
{{ statement.time|date:"F jS, P" }}
{{ statement.topic }}
http://openparliament.ca{{ statement.get_absolute_url }}
----------------------------------------------------------

{{ statement.text_plain|wordwrap:79 }}

{% endfor %}
